The default channels can cause the IK to react to everything.

Personal recommendation is to set the new trace channel's default collision response to \"ignore\". Then manually setting the collision of terrains to \"block\". If the IK can be overreaching objects, then it could just be a matter of the trace heights being too long in the solvers. Decreasing and tweaking them will help. Experiment with different trace shapes (Line,Sphere,Box) to see what would be a good fit. There are many parameters one can tweak to acheive the desired results.

Aim IK youtube tutorial Core Setup 1) Find the \"Dragon Aim Look Solver\" blueprint node in the animation graph. 2) Type the \"Start Bone\" (eg:- Head) and \"End Bone\" (eg:- Chest or Pelvis). 3) A transform widget appears in the animation blueprint viewport if setup is valid. Move the widget around to easily test the aiming of the character. 4) Supply a transform variable to the \"LookAt Transform\" transform node. This variable is the target location in world space. Advanced Setup 1) Follow all the steps in the core setup. 2) (optional step)Type the bone names in the \"dragon input data\". Ensure correct bone names are added for pelvis,spine-start and foot bones. This data is used for the feet planting IK when the character is aiming. 3) If hand aiming is needed for cases like \"rifle aiming\" or \"sword swing aiming\", set the hand bones in the hand array. Set the shoulder,elbow and hand bones. 4) Tweak the clamp parameters under the \"Advanced Clamp Settings\". Separate clamp parameters are available for body,head and limbs. 5) \"Max body clamp\" controls the rotation limit of the main body. It works in conjunction with the \"Body Clamp Curve\" curve editor inside the solver. Tweak if needed. 6) The \"Body clamp curve\" is a curve parameter that multiplies with the \"Max body clamp\" parameter, from the end bone (0.0 x-value) to the start bone (1.0 x-value). You can tweak it to have varied clamping for individual bones of the body. 7) Increase or decrease the maximum clamp limits both vertically and horizontally. 8) \"Limb Clamp\" controls how far or how little the arms can follow the target. Tweak it as needed. Higher values are good for gun aiming, and lower values are used for wings suspension when aiming while flying (for birds). 9) If aiming using a handheld weapon such as a gun or a sword but there is an offset in the aim, then tweak \"target aim offset\" as needed. 10) Enable or disable the \"use relative rotation algorithm\" to switch between two type of aiming algorithm. 11) Details for each parameters are provided inside the tooltips. Experimentation is encouraged. Check out the example project in github to see awesome example setup. Useful tips The aim solver can be used also for aiming tails of a character. The setup is the same, but the \"lookat vector\" parameter needs to be inversed. (eg:- If the lookatvector of the character is using the default (0,1,0) then the tail solver need to use (0,-1,0) as the vector input since the tail is facing backwards compared to the rest of the body) Everything learnt here can be directly applied for providing good aim solving for humans,quadrupeds,spiders,snakes and even more varieties of characters.","title":"Aim Solver Setup (Generic)"},{"location":"Aiming%20IK%20Tutorials/e-aimsolver/#aim-solver-setup-all-type-generic","text":"A generic aiming IK solver that aims and rotates a sequence of bones towards a target location.","title":"Aim Solver Setup (All Type Generic)"},{"location":"Aiming%20IK%20Tutorials/e-aimsolver/#aim-ik-youtube-tutorial","text":"","title":"Aim IK youtube tutorial"},{"location":"Aiming%20IK%20Tutorials/e-aimsolver/#core-setup","text":"1) Find the \"Dragon Aim Look Solver\" blueprint node in the animation graph. 2) Type the \"Start Bone\" (eg:- Head) and \"End Bone\" (eg:- Chest or Pelvis). 3) A transform widget appears in the animation blueprint viewport if setup is valid.

Decrease or tweak the \"shift speed\" as well as the interpolation parameters such as \"location lerp speed\" and \"rotation lerp speed\" Leg knees are bending in undesirable directions ? The direction of the knee bending is calculated based on the existing bends of the legs of the animation. This ensure the knee bending is perfectly natural and in-tune with the animation. If by any chance the knees are bending in an awkward direction, the animation of the legs might need to be tweaked either in the animation software, or just directly in unreal using the personna editor.

Whether it is for quadrupeds, gun aiming or even 3-point VR solving. Table Core input data This is the most important input data to supply for the aim solver to work. Everything else in the solver are optional according to individual use case. Parameter Description Start Bone (Eg:- Head) The head bone. End Bone The last bone to be influenced. (Eg:- Pelvis or chest) LookAtLocation Target location transform in world space Optional Input Data These are the optional inputs, such as the leg and arm data. The leg data is used for reverse IK of the feets when the body is aiming. The hand input is needed for the arm aiming/reaching logic. Parameter Description Dragon Input Data (optional) Type the input bones used by the solver - pelvis,spine-start and feets. Any wrong bone typing mistake can cause the solver to fail. Hands Input (optional) The hand inputs. Used for seperate clamping and restricting of limb movements during body aiming. Uses : Weapon aiming, hand restriction while extreme body bending, wings stability etc Main Arm Index Reaching & Separate Arm Aim This section only handles the optional logic of multi-arm aiming and reaching. If you desire dual gun aiming or even 3-point VR arm solving, then this section is your friend. Parameter Description Overrided arm aim target transform array Separate aim targets array for hands. Break this parameter after exposing to expose the array for dynamic modification. Hand aiming/reaching use the overrided target transform array ? If enabled, the overrided arm aim target array is used for the hand aiming. Hand rotations use the overrided target transforms ? If enabled, the arm rotation is mirrored by the target transform's rotation. Allow hand stretching ? If enabled, the arms can stretch beyond its original bone length constraints. Reach instead of aiming ? (Only for arms) Switching between arm aiming and reaching. Reaching is great when dynamically picking objects of holding something. Enable this for VR IK arms. Make hands positions influence body ? (If using multi-arm aiming) If enabled, the body rotation is influenced by the arm target locations. Only if reaching mode is enabled. Should arm twist when hand rotates ? (If reaching mode) You can completely ignore arm twisting and just twist the hands alone. Arm pole system method Select the pole system for the arms. Only used if reaching mode is used. Arm twist axis technique Choose the axis of your arm twisting. Only used if reaching mode is used. Hand rotation method Decide if the hand rotation is additively calculated or directly replaced by the hand transforms. Override head rotation to use the look transform rotation ? If this is enabled, then the head rotation uses the rotation of the look target transform instead of aiming at the target. It can be used to set the VR hmd rotation into the head bone, to get the head rotation in all angles. Enable arm interpolation ? Enable this for getting arms to interpolate instead of snapping to location. Arm interpolation is different from the other interpolation parameter. Arm interpolation speed It's the speed of the arm interpolation. Advanced Clamping Settings All your core clamping parameters are held here. Whether it is for the head,body,arms or even the overall max-min clamp of everything. Parameter Description Max Body Lookat Clamp The maximum allowed body chain rotation. Uses the body clamp curve as a multiplier for the final result. Inner Body Lookat Treshold This is a treshold angle limit for the body aiming. If the angles cross this treshold, then the bones will start the aiming process. Head Max Clamp Maximum separate limbs clamp. Can be used to shrink the angle or extend the angle with respect to the body clamp. Ignored if seperate head clamp bool is disabled. Limbs Max Clamp Maximum separate limbs clamp. Can be used to shrink the max angle or extend the max angle with respect to the body clamp. Max Vertical Angle Range (Degrees) Max global vertical rotation clamp. Beyond these clamps, the aiming reverses. Max Horizontal Angle Range (Degrees) Max global horizontal rotation clamp. Beyond these clamps, the aiming reverses. Multiplier Settings These are multiplier parameters that helps fine-tune the body dipping logic in various scenarios. Parameter Description Downward translation when aiming upwards (Multiplier) The extra dip downwards if character is looking vertically upwards. Downward translation when aiming downwards The extra dip downwards if character is looking vertically downwards. Vertical Dip Treshold This is the \"gap\" until the body starts to dip when aiming downwards. Sideward translation when aiming sideways (Multiplier) The extra offset of the root bone in left/right if character's end bone is rotating towards the same direction. Downward translation when aiming sideways (Multiplier) The extra offset of the root bone in left/right if character's root bone is rotate towards the same direction. Vertical aim clamp ratio for body Tweak this if you want the clamp intensity to be different in the vertical axis. It is a multiplier ratio, and clamp is relative to existing setup. 0 = Absolutley no vertical body bending/aiming. 1 = Full Vertical body bending/aiming. Only applies to body chain. Ignores arms and head. Curve Input Settings There are the curve parameters that work in tangent with other parameters. Parameter Description Bone Clamp Curve Curve clamp used to tweak the body bending limits. Works as a multiplier and is part of the total solving calculation. 0th value in X-axis denotes the clamp intensity of the end bone (eg:- if max body clamp is 100, and the 0th value is 0.1, then the final clamp of pelvis/end bone is 10). All values until the 1st value in the X-axis are multipliers for all the bone chains from End to Start bones. Exact 1st X-axis value is ignored, as the head clamp is solely determined by the separate head clamp parameter. Body Rotation Multiplier Curve Curve multiplier to tweak the rotation multiplier in the body chain. Default set to 1 always. No need for modification in most cases. Toggle Settings Parameter Description Should feets be locked using IK ? Lock legs to its original position using IK as the body moves and rotates. Only works with valid dragon input data. Ignore Elbow Compression Only rotate the shoulder towards the target, and ignore the wrist and elbow in the solving. Ignore Seperate Hand solving Turn off separate limbs aiming. Use Relative Rotation Algorithm ? Switch between two different rotation algorithm for different type of results. [enabled] = Relative rotation algorithm provides greater degree of freedom of movement and stable poses. Favours pose stability over accuracy. [disabled] = Non-Relative rotation algorthm provides a more direct and natural aiming but with limit in the range of motion. Favours accuracy over pose stability. Use Separate independent clamping for head ? If enabled, the heads clamp is determined by the separate max head clamp parameter. If disabled, the head clamp is determined by the value in the clamp curve graph along with the rest of the body. Also influenced by max body clamp parameter.If using the aim solver for tails, keep this disabled. Head use exact accurate aiming ? If enabled, head aims exactly at the target regardless of the rest of the body chain. If disabled, head aims while adjusting itself with respect to the rest of the body chain. Can result in a bit more stable but offseted aiming. Enable Solver Toggle this parameter to instantly turn on/off ik. Automatic Foot-Knee-Thigh detection Parameter to choose between automatic feet bone detection or manual method. If enabled, solvers only uses the feet bones, and automatically assumes the next 2 parent bones as knees and thighs. If disabled, solvers uses the feet bones, knee bones and thigh bones typed in the feet array. If disabled, all bones need to be valid. Any invalid bones will not activate the ik. Very useful to keep it disabled on DAZ rigs and certain animal characters, where the thigh-knee-foot are not in a straight linear hierarchy. Work outside gameplay (For sequencer) Enable this to make the solvers calcualte everytime, even during non-gameplay scenarios. Such as sequencer recording sessions. Tail Terrain Settings This is a special section that makes the bone chain to adapt to the terrain. It can be used for long necks of a dragon, or even long tails of a character. A single trace line is fired for the terrain solving calculation if using these features. Parameter Description Is it a terrain addaptive chain ? (like tails) Enable this to turn this solver into an automatic terrain adaptive chain. The lookatlocation parameter is disabled here, in favour of the debuglooklocation as the base reference of the height. The viewport look widget will be used as reference for the in-game terrain adaption. TAC Collision channel Trace channel used by the solver traces. Recommended to create a new dedicated trace channel for the ik through project settings. Trace Up Height This is the upward height of the trace from the lookat widget. Trace Down Height This is the downward height of the trace from the lookat widget. Interpolation Settings Parameter Description Interpolation Type Select the type of interpolation method. Enable Interpolation A boolean to enable/disable overall interpolation. Arms interpolation is independent. Interpolation Speed Speed of solving interpolation. Toggle Interpolation Speed Speed of interpolation between toggling the on/off state of the aim IK. Look At Settings All the forward and upward axis of the character can be defined here. Tweak according to the general direction the character faces in component space. Parameter Description Forward Axis The forward direction axis of the character. Characters using the standard unreal directions use the default value. Upward Axis The up direction axis of the character. Characters using the standard unreal directions use the default (0,0,1) value. Target Offset (only for limbs) Useful for tweaking the aiming offset of arms/limbs. Popular use is for weapons aiming and accuracy. Offset works in component space. Use Reference Forward Axis Logic ? If using mocap or any use case that involves altering the forward axis during gameplay, this can be enabled to dynamically alter the arm and leg poles along with the along with the change in axis. The forward axis is compared with the reference forward axis to calculate the offset of the poles. If they are the same, then nothing happens. Reference Forward Axis This parameter is mainly useful when using mocap animations that involves the character rotating its root bone in multiple directions. It is the default forward vector of your character in component space. The forward vector is compared with the reference forward vector to appropriately alter the knee poles and elbow poles and correcting them. If your character is setup in standard unreal forward axis, then there is no need to alter this. Debugging Only There are mainly used for debugging purposes, such as the widget locations. Parameter Description Debug Look at Location Used for internal animation blueprint viewport for debugging. Real gameworld uses \"LookAtLocation\".If Tail Terrain Adaptive mode is enabled, then this is turned into a constant height reference point from which the line trace is fired.

Instead of calculating from the normal data of the terrain, the rotation is calculated from approximating the results of the position of the 4 traces. 4-line traces around the feet. This helps rotate the feets even on sharp terrains more logically. Enable foot lift limit ? (Uses the foot extension ratios in foot array) Enable the ability to limit the lift of the feets. This limit is controlled from the feet array. Calculate toe/finger rotations ? Enable this to unlock and use the finger solving algorithm for each defined finger in the feet array. Finger IK alpha relative to velocity This is a curve that multiplies the finger IK alpha with itself. X-axis is velocity and Y-value is the finger alpha multiplier. Default value basically disables finger IK during locomotion. Minimum allowed leg IK angle This is the clamping of the leg IK accordingly Work outside gameplay (for sequencer) Enable this for having the IK work even outside gameplay, such as in the editor during sequencer recordings.","title":"Basic Settings"},{"location":"IK%20Solvers%20Info/footsolver/#dynamic-foot-offset","text":"Parameter Description (optional) Foot x height offset These are optional feet height offsets which be comfortably and dynamically modified for your purpose, instead of creating programatically creating inputs and supplying it.","title":"Dynamic foot offset"},{"location":"IK%20Solvers%20Info/footsolver/#performance","text":"Parameter Description LOD Treshold The maximum LOD the IK solver will work with. -1 means the solver will work at all LOD levels.","title":"Performance"},{"location":"IK%20Solvers%20Info/spinesolver/","text":"Dragon Spine Solver This solver modifies the body to adjust itself to the terrain. It does not modify the feet positions on its own, as that is handled by the Dragon Foot Solver. Table Input Data Parameter Description dragon input data Type the input bones used by the solver - pelvis,spine-start and feets Solver Parameter Description Precision Tolerance for final tip location delta from EffectorLocation MaximumPitch Maximum spine rotation in pitch axis MaximumRoll Maximum spine rotation in roll axis MaxIterations Maximum number of iterations allowed. Basic Settings Parameter Description Alpha Alpha of the entire solver. 0 means no solving and 1 means maximum solving. Shift Speed The transistion speed between solve and unsolve state (eg:- when character jumps and falls back to ground). Lower values means slower but smoother transition. Trace_Channel Trace channel used by the solver traces. Recommended to create a new dedicated trace channel for the ik through project settings. Anti Trace Channel The repelling trace channel useful for handling close space areas. Trace Type Select if using line,sphere or box trace for IK solving. Trace_Radius If trace type is box or sphere, its radius is controlled using the Trace Radius Global trace scale multiplier Uniformly increases all trace related parameters (Trace down height,Trace up height,Max feet-terrain...distance, Min terrain-capsule...distance). I personally just use this rather than individually tweaking each trace parameter. Trace Downward Height Line trace height below the spines/feets Trace Upward Height Line trace height above the spines/feets Use Anti-Channel Functionality Use the anti-channel in the solving logic. Use meshes with the anti-channel set to \"block\" to repel the traces from touching ceilings and closed spaces. Also useful when under stairs or narrow multi-storied buildings. Cover the ceilings and under stairs with anti-channel blocked meshes. Calculation Relative To Ref Pose Should solver calculation be based on the default reference pose or the current animated pose ? Maximum Feet-Terrain Fail Distance Maximum distance from feet to terrain to allow the solving to happen. Higher value makes the ik to solve even on terrains far below the character Minimum Terrain-Capsule Activation Distance The minimum distance between feet and terrain to allow solving to happen. Increase this value if ik is turning off easilly on slopes. Too high of a value can make the ik to \"stick\" to the ground more, which can be undesirable. Recommended to tweak this value until it feels right Master Curve Settings Parameter Description Use custom velocity instead of automatic character velocity for curves ? Enable this to use your custom player velocity instead of automatically getting it from the parent character class movement component. This velocity value will be used to drive the curve parameters that depend on velocity. Custom curve velocity This is used as the velocity if \"Use custom velocity...\" parameter is enabled. Advanced Settings Parameter Description LOD Threshold Max LOD that this node is allowed to run Rotate and move bone around terrain ? Enable this to rotate the pelvis and chest is perfect perpendicular fashion. Good for general purpose, but can cause extreme rotation and translations in wild,sharp and uneven surfaces. Recommended to experiment between this enabled and disabled. Solving method for bones between pelvis and chest There are 2 options, simple solving & legacy fabrik method. Legacy solving handles all the bones between the pelvis and chest through FABRIK. Simple solving avoids FABRIK for the in-between bones, and instead just linearly positions the bones. Simple method preserves pose structure better, so it could be more stable apart from being cheaper. Ignore Lerping Disable both location and rotation interpolation Reverse Fabrik Enable this to prioritise chest over the pelvis. The normal fabrik mode prioritises the pelvis transformation location when on extreme terrains. The reverse fabrik mode ensures chest is given priority. Alternate Cross Radius (4 green trace lines) This is the spacing width of the 4 trace lines arranged in a cross pattern, around both pelvis and chest bones. Ensure the spacing radius is tweaked to the spacing of the feet. This is used for important subtle calculations, such as detecting slopes/flat surfaces. Used for rotation calculation if \"Alternate cross based rotation\" is enabled. Rotation alpha between end points This is the rotation alpha value of all the bones between the pelvis and chest. 1 value means full solved state, while 0 means 0 solved state. Trace Interpolation Speed This is the interpolation of the trace hit data. These work hand-in-hand with the body location interpolation speed, to create an additional layer of interpolation to provide really smooth results. Body Location Interpolation Speed Controls the location interpolation speed of the body. Higher values means faster interpolation. Slower values means slower but also smoother interpolation. Body Rotation Interpolation Speed Controls the rotation interpolation speed of the body. Higher values means faster interpolation. Slower values means slower but also smoother interpolation. Interpolation multiplier relative to velocity curve This is a curve that multiplies the total interpolation with itself. X-axis is velocity and Y-value is the interpolation multiplier. Tweak this for appropriate speed of interpolation between idle & running state. Chest Influence Alpha The location alpha value for the chest. 1 means full solving of the chest transformation. 0 means no solving of the chest transformation. Chest rotation still works regardless. Enable Solver Enable/Disable the solver Force Activation This will force the ik to work at all times. Animals will not be able to jump if this is enabled. Only recommended for testing and debugging purposes. accurate feet placement Enable this to use proper accurate feet placement logic. But it might provide jumpy nature for certain quadrupeds like horses when they are moving on slopes. Recommended use case is to disable this when a quadruped animal is moving, but enable it when it is idle. Accurate-Simple foot placement curve relative to velocity curve This is a curve that switches between accurate foot placement and simple foot placement modes. X-axis is velocity. Y-value at 1 means accurate foot placement, while Y-value at 0 means simple foot placement . Tweak this for appropriate foot placement method depending on idle & running state. use crosshair trace also for fail distance Enable this to use the 4 cross based traces to turn off the ik, if any of the trace hits are too far. Solve only pelvis bone ? Enable this to only solve the pelvis bone, while the remaining bones remain unchanged. Recommended to enable it for bipeds like humans and raptors. Also recommended for single root spiders. Avoid solving chest bone ? This is avoid solving only the chest bone, while the rest of the bones will still be modified as usual. This can be enabled if you don't desire tweaking the rotation of the chest bone using the forward rotation intensity parameter. Overall PostSolved Offset Additional offset parameters to the overall bones Leg,Head & Tail Stabilization Parameter Description Stabilize legs connected to pelvis during body bending ? This is to stabilize the rotation of the leg connnected to the pelvis and act independent from the body rotations. (Upslope) Pelvic legs stabilization alpha This is an alpha that can lerp between 0 (default) and 1 (stabilized) modes for the pelvic legs if the entire body is going upslope. (Downslope) Pelvic legs stabilization alpha This is an alpha that can lerp between 0 (default) and 1 (stabilized) modes for the pelvic legs if the entire body is going downslope. Stabilize legs connected to chest during body bending ? This is to stabilize the rotation of the leg connnected to the chest and act independent from the body rotations. (Upslope) Chest legs stabilization alpha This is an alpha that can lerp between 0 (default) and 1 (stabilized) modes for the chest legs if the entire body is going upslope. (Downslope) Chest legs stabilization alpha This is an alpha that can lerp between 0 (default) and 1 (stabilized) modes for the chest legs if the entire body is going downslope. (optional) Head bone to be stabilized Similar to the legs, the head rotation can be stabilized here. This only works if chest legs stabilization is enabled. (optional) Tail bone to be stabilized Similar to the legs, the tail rotation can be stabilized here. This only works if pelvis legs stabilization is enabled. [Pelvis/Chest] Control Settings Parameter Description Extra dip When going up slopes Extra dip when pelvis is on an upward slope Extra dip When going down slopes Extra dip when pelvis is on a downward slope Extra dip multiplier relative to feet lift difference If your character isn't dipping enough to touch the ground during slopes, slightly increase this value. Only handles dipping based on the pairs of feet and the difference between their respective trace hit location. Will not dip on flat surfaces. Pelvis gravity priority -1 means priority of [Pelvis/Chest]dip is towards the lowest touching leg. +1 means priority of dip is towards the highest touching leg. This value can be tweaked to have a balanced overall dipping result. [Pelvis/Chest] Z Offset Optional additional Z offset for the [Pelvis/Chest] Maximum Dip Height - [Pelvis/Chest] Maximum height the [Pelvis/Chest] can dip below the base pose. Lower values means [Pelvis/Chest] will dip less. For biped (2 feet) characters, this is only used. [Pelvis/Chest] dip height multiplier relative to velocity This is a curve that multiplies the maximum dip height with itself. X-axis is velocity and Y-value is the dip multiplier. Tweak this for appropriate max dip when in idle and walking/running. Down slope [Pelvis/Chest] forward rotation intensity Controls the intensity of the [Pelvis/Chest] forward rotation with respect to the slopes. 0 means no rotation applied. Up slope [Pelvis/Chest] forward rotation intensity Controls the intensity of the [Pelvis/Chest] forward rotation with respect to the slopes. 0 means no rotation applied. [Pelvis/Chest] Sideward Rotation Intensity on slopes Controls the intensity of the [Pelvis/Chest] sideward rotation with respect to the slopes. 0 means no rotation applied. [Pelvis & Chest] Post Rotation Offset Fixed rotation offsets to be applied on [Pelvis/Chest] Use Alternate Cross-Based [Pelvis/Chest] Rotation Enable this to use the 4 cross-based trace lines to determine the rotation of the pelvis instead of the default normal method Experimental Parameter Description Automatic Fabrik Selection (Development) An experimental feature, where the solver automatically switch between fabrik and reverse fabrik mode depending on the slope. Spine advanced tweaks Parameter Description Is spine always fully extended ? Enable this to allow spine to bend and modify at a fixed maximum length Fully extended ratio The ratio length the spine stretches if full extension is enabled. Non extended ratio The minimum ratio length the spine can stretch upto if full extension is disabled Extension Switch Speed The speed of the spine extension/compression during slopes Component direction settings Parameter Description Up Direction Vector The up direction vector of the character in component space. 99% cases, this should not be altered. Forward Direction Vector The forward direction vector of the character in component space. 99% cases, this should not be altered. Flip forward and right rotation If character is rigged and animated in the opposite direction to the standard unreal forward/right directions, then enable this. 99% cases, this should not be altered. Miscellaneous Parameter Description Solver Reference Pose Whether to use the reference pose or animated pose for calculations. Strict Spine-Feet pair finding Automatically correct the spine and feet bone pairing with respect to the typed bone names in the input settings. If correct bone names are typed, it makes no difference in the end. Snake settings Parameter Description Is it a snake ? Enable snake mode. If character is either a snake or a worm, enable this. Can also be turned on for biped characters sleeping or proning on the ground. Enable Snake Interpolation A boolean to enable the snake chain solving interpolation. Disabling it will give instant solving without any smoothening. Snake Joint Speed (If snake true) Spine interpolation speed if snake mode is enabled.

VR-IK solving More information will be added later on how to setup it up, but meanwhile here is the link to the example project. 3-Point VR solving example project. Check if line traces are drawn in the animation blueprint viewport If your character feels like its not reacting to the terrains, check the animation blueprint viewport. Click on any of your solvers and see if the red lines and/or other widgets are showing up in the viewport. If nothing is showing up, then there is atleast one badly typed bone name. Tweak knee direction offsets to legs bending in bad directions For characters like horses which has straight vertical leg poses, the direction of the bending of legs can appear random when on slopes. To mitigate this, move the blue pole vectors of the foot solver in the animation graph viewport. The bending is directed by the direction of these poles.

Replacing the IK of ALS projects with DragonIK Re-compiling the plugin (Bonus info on how to make your existing plugin work for UE5) 1. Basic Preparation Create a blank empty C++ project for UE5. I named it as \"UnrealFiveCPlus\". Copy your 4.26 plugin from the engine marketplace folder. The directory structure looks like this : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Epic Games\\UE_4.26\\Engine\\Plugins\\Marketplace\\DragonIK then paste it inside the \"Plugins\" folder of your new blank C++ project. If no folder for Plugins exist, then create one. After its pasted, right click on the .uproject of your C++ project. Click \"generate visual studio files\". Only after doing this step will the plugin be visible later in visual studio. Now open your project in visual studio. Open the \".uplugin\" file in the root folder of DragonIK and rename 4.26.2 to 5.0. Build your project \"UnrealFiveCPlus\" or whatever you have named it. Since nothing is changed, errors will show up. 2. UE4 -> UE5 specific Modification First step, close all files unrelated to the plugin in VS. Then selectively open all DragonIK related files present in the Source folder. Once they are all opened, replace all references of FWidget in the plugin to the new UE:Widget using the \"All open documents\" option so its done instantly. More than 20 references will be updated. Do a \"Save All\" now. Similarly replace all references of \"SkeletalMesh->Skeleton\" into \"SkeletalMesh->GetSkeleton()\". Save all. Do a rebuild of your project. Now most errors are gone except an unresolved external symbol error. This external symbol error is due to an additional new module UE5 introduced called \"EditorFramework\". Go to DragonIKPluginEditor.Build.cs and add \"EditorFramework\" under the private dependency module names of the Editor target type. A simple tip is to add \"EditorFramework\" right next to the \"Persona\" module.","title":"Super Useful Tips"},{"location":"Tips%20%26%20Tricks/UsefulTips/#useful-tips-and-solutions-to-common-problems","text":"","title":"Useful tips and solutions to common problems"},{"location":"Tips%20%26%20Tricks/UsefulTips/#create-a-custom-trace-channel","text":"Create a custom trace channel that can be used by your IK.
